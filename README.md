The Game of Life is a perfect game to test ones fundamental ability in any
programming language due to its simplistic but mathematically powerful premise.
It can also be done without experience coding GUIs, due to its ease in
displaying through just a text-based console.

The programs in this repo are my versions of the Game of Life in various
programming languages.
